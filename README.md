Web Spiders
===========

Practice/proof of concept coding projects that include:

Spyder

- A Scrapy web scraper that collects links from a webpage, and then saves the link data to an Oracle backend.
  - Additionally, Spyder saves link data as a local json file (data.json).


Link Spyder Project

- Django webserver that reads link data (populated via the web scraper Spyder) from a local Oracle database and presents the data in a sortable table.


Link Visualizer
